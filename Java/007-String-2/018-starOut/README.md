018 - Java - String-2
=====================


starOut
----------

Problem:  
Return a version of the given string, where for every star (*) in the string the star and the chars immediately to its left and right are gone. So "ab*cd" yields "ad" and "ab**cd" also yields "ad". 
>
starOut("ab*cd") → "ad"  
starOut("ab**cd") → "ad"  
starOut("sm*eilly") → "silly"
