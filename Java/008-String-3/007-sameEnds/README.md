007 - Java - String-3
=====================

sameEnds
----------

Problem:  
Given a string, return the longest substring that appears at both the beginning and end of the string without overlapping. For example, sameEnds("abXab") is "ab". 

sameEnds("abXYab") → "ab"
sameEnds("xx") → "x"
sameEnds("xxx") → "x"
